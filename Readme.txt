This is the list of fragments to generate 

- Wprime signals with pythia8 generator and TuneCUETP8M1 for the underlying event.
    Masses: 1TeV up to 5.8 TeV, in steps of 200 GeV.  20 kevts for each mass point.
- W bosons from SM with a high mass cut, also with pythia8 and the same TuneCUETP8M1 
    Masses: M(W) > 200, 500, 1000 and 3000 GeV. 1 million evts per each mass point

For each boson type (Wprime, W) there are 3 decay modes considered: 
Muon+Neutrino, Electron+Neutrino and Tau+Neutrino

The list of cross sections (pb), size and time per event is in
